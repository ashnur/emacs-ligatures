* Thoughts

what if I maintained two separate buffers
one with the composed indentation and the other with the true indentation
the true buffer uses this overlay display trick
the fake buffer uses compose region instead
and we keep track of the indentation differences at each line
and then use the spacing trick on all lines with different indentation

"indirect buffers can have different major modes, overlays, markers"

Create a blank mode that only takes indentation from parent mode
create indirect buffer and set to this blank mode
since it is an indirect buffer, they share text naturally

since I cant make a separate overlay for compose
I could instead make an invisible overlay mirroring the lig-overlay

note can use evaporate property to nil the overlay automatically

note look at after-string and before-string properties for overlay

* Scratch code

`text-property-any'
`text-properties-at'
'(?\s (Br . Bl) ?\s)
'(?\s (Br . Bl) ?\s (Br . Bl) ?\s)
(prettify-utils-generate (" " "  "))

    ;; ;; add spacing overlays
    ;; (setq cur-line 1)


    ;; (save-excursion
    ;;   (while (> (lig-diff-in-indent start end num-lines) 0)
    ;;     (forward-line num-lines)
    ;;     (put-text-property (point) (+ 3 (point)) 'invisible t)
    ;;     ;; (compose-region (point) (+ 4 (point)) ?\s)

    ;;     (setq num-lines (1+ num-lines))
    ;;     ))))
